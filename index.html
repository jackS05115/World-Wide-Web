      <p><i>My people use the terms <b>Internet</b> and the <b>World Wide Web</b> interchangeably,<br>
      but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous. The Internet and the Web are two<br>
      separated but relate things.</p>
      <p>The <b>Internet</b> is a massive networks, a networks, a networking infrastructure. It<br>
      connects millions of computer together globally, forming a network in which<br>
      any computer can communicate with other computers as long they are both<br>
      connected to the internet. Information can travel via the internet via a variety of<br>
      languages called "Protocols".</p>
      <p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> or simply "Web", is a way of accessing information over<br>
      the medium of the internet. it is an information-sharing model that is built on top<br>
      of the internet. The Web uses the <b>HTTP protocol</b>, only one of the languages<br>
      spoken over the internet, to transmit data.</i></p>
